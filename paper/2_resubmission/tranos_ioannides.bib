  abstract = { The author investigates how high-speed home Internet use has affected labor supply. Using an instrumental variables strategy that exploits cross-state variation in supply-side constraints to residential broadband Internet access, she finds that exogenously determined high-speed Internet use leads to a 4.1 percentage point increase in labor force participation for married women. No corresponding effect is found for single women or men. Among married women, the largest increases in participation are found among college-educated women with children. Supplemental analyses suggest that Internet use for telework and saving time in home production explains the increase in participation. The results suggest that home Internet facilitates work-family balance.}

abstract="Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have changed societies all over the world through the way we interact and the way we live. By increasing efficiency and information, lowering transaction costs and creating jobs, ICTs have also changed the way we work. ICTs are presumed to especially beneficial for women, who traditionally have been limited from working by time and mobility constraints. Previous studies have been conducted on a microlevel, but few attempts have been made to systematically investigate the relationship between ICTs, female employment and development on the macrolevel. This chapter investigates whether ICTs have an impact on gender equality in the labor market and are among the first to investigate the global trends. Using panel data analysis for 156 countries from the period 1991--2014, this chapter argues that ICTs contribute positively to narrowing the gender gap in labor market participation, mainly due to increased female labor force participation. However, the impact is lower in developing countries, suggesting that ICT is not necessarily a leapfrogging strategy, many are hoping for in terms of female labor force participation and a more gender-equal labor market.",
